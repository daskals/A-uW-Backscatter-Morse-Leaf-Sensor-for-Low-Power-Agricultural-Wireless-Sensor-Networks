# A uW Backscatter-Morse-Leaf Sensor for Low-Power Agricultural Wireless Sensor Networks
Design files of IEEE publication: A uW Backscatter-Morse-Leaf Sensor for Low-Power Agricultural Wireless Sensor Networks


Nowadays, the monitoring of plant water stress
is of high importance in smart agriculture. Instead of the
traditional ground soil-moisture measurement, leaf sensing is a
new technology, which is used for the detection of plants needing
water. In this work, a novel, low-cost and low-power system for
leaf sensing using a new plant backscatter sensor node/tag is
presented. The latter, can result in the prevention of water waste
(water-use efficiency), when is connected to an irrigation system.
Specifically, the sensor measures the temperature differential
between the leaf and the air, which is directly related to the plant
water stress. Next, the tag collects the information from the leaf
sensor through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and then,
communicates remotely with a low-cost software-defined radio
(SDR) reader using monostatic backscatter architecture. The tag
consists of the sensor board, a microcontroller, an external timer
and an RF front-end for communication. The timer produces a
subcarrier frequency for simultaneous access of multiple tags.
The proposed work could be scaled and be a part of a large
backscatter wireless sensor network (WSN). The communication
protocol exploits the low-complexity Morse code modulation on
a 868 MHz carrier signal. The presented novel proof-of-consent
prototype is batteryless and was powered by a flexible solar panel
consuming power around 20 µW. The performance was validated
in an indoors environment where wireless communication was
successfully achieved up to 2 m distance.
